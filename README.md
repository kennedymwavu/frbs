R wrapper for [Firebase Authentication REST
API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth).

`{frbs}` enables you to integrate Firebase Authentication services
seamlessly into your projects, allowing for user authentication, account
management, and other authentication-related tasks.

It is designed to be used on the backend of your applications. This
flexibility allows you to build the login & registration pages using
whichever framework you wish eg.
[shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny),
[ambiorix](https://github.com/devOpifex/ambiorix), etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{frbs}` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kennedymwavu/frbs")
```

## Usage

1.  Create a [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Grab the projectâ€™s API key and place it in your `.Renviron` as
    `FIREBASE_API_KEY`:
    `r     FIREBASE_API_KEY = Your-API-Key-Goes-Here`
3.  Restart your R session.
4.  Connect to your frontend.
