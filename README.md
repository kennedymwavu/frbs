# `frbs`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

R wrapper for [Firebase Authentication REST
API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth).

Designed to be used on the backend of your R applications, whether web
or non-web.

`{frbs}` enables you to integrate Firebase Authentication services
seamlessly into your projects, allowing for user authentication, account
management, and other authentication-related tasks.

Suitable if you need absolute full control on how you build & customize
your login & registration process/pages, while still using Firebase
Auth.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{frbs}` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kennedymwavu/frbs")
```

## Usage

1.  Create a [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2.  Grab the projectâ€™s API key and place it in your `.Renviron` as
    `FIREBASE_API_KEY`:

    ``` r
    FIREBASE_API_KEY = Your-API-Key-Goes-Here
    ```

3.  Restart your R session.

4.  Connect to your frontend.

Functions in the package are named similarly to the descriptions in the
[Firebase Authentication REST
API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth) docs, and
they all have the prefix `frbs_`.
